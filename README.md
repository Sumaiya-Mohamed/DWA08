#Title: DWA06 (Abstraction)

#Description: This is an updated version of my book connect app where I have improved the code by using abstraction methods as well as a pdf file where I have listed examples of bad abstractions and how to implement the SOLID principles to make them better and examples of good abstractions that can help manage the complexity of code.
